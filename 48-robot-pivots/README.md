# Robot Pivots

Robots can pivot left and right.

The robot factory manufactures robots that have three possible movements:

* turn right
* turn left
* advance

The factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

There are a number of different rooms of varying sizes, measured in Robot
Units, the distance a robot moves when you instruct it to `advance`.

The floor of the room is a grid, each square of which measures 1 square RU
(Robot Unit).

The rooms are always oriented so that each wall faces east, south, west, and
north.

The test algorithm is to place a robot at a coordinate in the room, facing in a particular direction.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing
facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is
pointing.

Your task is it implement the robot testing algorithm.
