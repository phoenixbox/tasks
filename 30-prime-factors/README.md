# Prime Factors

Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.

## Test Cases

```
prime factors of 1 => []
prime factors of 2 => [2]
prime factors of 3 => [3]
prime factors of 4 => [2,2]
prime factors of 5 => [5]
prime factors of 6 => [2,3]
prime factors of 7 => [7]
prime factors of 8 => [2,2,2]
prime factors of 9 => [3,3]
#... etc
```

Expect to write more tests than the cases shown here.

In number theory, the prime factors of a positive integer are the prime numbers that divide that integer exactly. The process of finding these numbers is called integer factorization, or prime factorization. 

A prime factor can be visualized by understanding Euclid's geometric position. He saw a whole number as a line segment, which has a smallest line segment greater than 1 that can divide equally into it.

For a prime factor p of n, the multiplicity of p is the largest exponent a for which pa divides n. 
For a prime factor 7 of 7, the multiplicity of 7 is the largest exponent a for which 7a divides 7.
