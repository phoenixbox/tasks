# From the docs:
# Agile development tool that monitors a directory tree, and triggers a
# user defined action whenever an observed file is modified. Its most
# typical use is continuous testing, and as such it is a more flexible
# alternative to autotest.
# To install:
# `gem install watchr`
# To use:
# watchr Watchrfile
